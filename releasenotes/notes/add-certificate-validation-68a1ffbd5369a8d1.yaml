    The cursive library supports the verification of digital signatures.
    However, there is no way currently to validate the certificate used to
    generate a given signature. Adding certificate validation improves the
    security of signature verification.
features:
  - Adds a variety of certificate utility functions that inspect certificate
    attributes and extensions for different settings.
  - Adds support for loading certificates from a certificate trust store, a
    designated filesystem directory containing trusted root or intermediate
    certificates.
  - Adds the CertificateVerificationContext class which uses the trust store
    to conduct certificate validation, verifying that a given certificate is
    part of a certificate chain rooted in the trust store.
  - Updates the signature verification workflow to include certificate
    validation. This includes updating the signature verification API to
    accept an extra argument containing the filesystem path to the trust
    store directory.
upgrade:
  - The addition of certificate validation in the signature verification
    process breaks backwards compatibility. Signatures previously verifiable
    with cursive will not be verifiable unless their signing certificates
    or their root certificates are included in the certificate trust store.
security:
  - The addition of certificate validation in the signature verification
    process improves the security of signature verification. A signature is
    now no longer valid unless its corresponding certificate is also
    trusted.
  - The addition of support for a certificate trust store necessitates the
    protection of the trust store from unauthorized access. An adversary
    with trust store access could add or remove certificates from the trust
    store, allowing their signatures to be verified or preventing valid
    user signatures from being verified.
